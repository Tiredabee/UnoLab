WHAT WENT WELL:
    None of us knew each other before we started working on this project, so it was good that we got along pretty well. We also had
    an idea right at the start so we didn't spend a lot of time trying to think of ideas, and instead were able to start planning
    and working. Our idea was also pretty straight forward, and we were able to initially split it up into three classes so that each    
    person could work on one in their own time.

WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL:
    We definitely could've gotten the project done earlier to decrease stress due to timing, as well as communicated more constantly.
    We also learned more about debugging as we encountered many issues in the gameplay class as we began to develop and work on it.
    Much of our time was spent troubleshooting and checking what went wrong and what we needed to fix and how.

WHAT WE LEARNED:
    Starting to communicate, plan, and work with group project members as early as possible is extremely important and beneficial.
    Had we not started planning our project as early as we did for Lab 8, it probably wouldn't have gone as well due to
    projects/assignments for other classes and obligations we have. Starting early gives everyone time to work on their own time
    around anything else they may be doing.

WHY WE SHOULD GET FULL DISCRETIONARY POINTS:
    Even though Uno is a very popular household game, we should get full discretionary points because the game was complex to program    
    due to the consideration of the different card colors, the numbers, the types of non-number cards and the actions that were
    called by those cards. The user interface is also very clean and easy to use, and could be a lot of fun for people to use if they   
    wanted to play a fun game of Uno but didn't have any cards. It's also great for a group of people, since the game can handle up
    six people.
